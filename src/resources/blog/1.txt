A fresh project.
13 Janurary 2025

Today is the day I finally got around to starting this website. It isn't particularly interesting at the moment, but that will come with time. For now, I've at least made it a central hub for my various other profiles across the Internet. Eventually, I'll likely add a page for any photography I do. A page for my projects might be nice, but I feel my portfolio website already does that job. Then again, it's for programming projects. Anyway, I'll try to post here somewhat often.
